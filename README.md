Roadmap:
- Add flexible parser, that can track several channels from several ports, in different formats (binary, ascii, etc)
- Add plot presentation and control options
- Add on the go plugin writing (i.e. a small console, where one could add average, thresholds and alike)
- Export plot data, playback saved plots
- Choose X coordinate between time and sample mode
